            EDUCATION BACKGROUND
          </div>

          <div class="education-info">
            <p>
              I graduated high school from Blue Valley Southwest in 2020 and from there went on to JCCC for 2 years. While I was still in highschool, I took 
              a couple college of classes through JCCC's College Now program. The classes that I took then were CS 134, Programming Fundametals, and CS 205, Concepts of Programming Algorithms
              Using Java.
            </p>
            <p> 
              My first year at JCCC was focused primarly on fulfilling general education courses. It wasn't until my second year that I continued on in taking computer science classes.
              I graduated from JCCC in spring of 2022 with my associates in Liberal Arts. I then transferred to UMKC the following fall and continuted my computer science journey there.
              I will be expecting to graduate from UMKC in the spring of 2024. Below are the list of classes that I have taken at JCCC and UMKC.

            <h1>Console Based RPG Game</h1>
            <p>This was project was done in the CS 200 class at JCCC. For this project, a mini RPG game was developed in C++ using Microsoft's Visual Studio. This game featured two basic concepts: character creation and battling.
              For the character creation aspect, you can create a character with a custom name, choose a class for the character, and purchase items that your character can use in battle. For the battle aspect, you would battle against 
              an enemy and your options would be to attack, defend, and heal.

            <h1>Parser Project</h1>
            <p>This project was done in the CS 441 class at UMKC. In this project, a parser was written which would parse a simplified version of 70s-era BASIC code. The grammar that was parsed is shown below.
              The parser was written in the Racket programming langauge using the DrRacket IDE. The parser was developed using a technique known as top-down parsing where the program scans the code from top to bottom
              and tries to match the given code with the rules listed in the grammar.

              The first part involved creating conceptual data model, the second part involved creating the logical data model, and the third part invovled translating the logical data model in PostgreSQL which
              was done using the DBeaver program.

              and in each sprint a certain function of the game was to be implemented. This project was to be done in any language and in any program of our choice. I chose Java and the Eclipse program
