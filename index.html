            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's 
              standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
              It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
              in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
              including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>

            <p>
              I graduated high school from Blue Valley Southwest in 2020 and from there went on to JCCC for 2 years. While I was still in highschool, I took 
              a couple college of classes through JCCC's College Now program. The classes that I took then were CS 134, Programming Fundametals, and CS 205, Concepts of Programming Algorithms
              Using Java.
            </p>
            <p> 
              My first year at JCCC was focused primarly on fulfilling general education courses. It wasn't until my second year that I continued on in taking computer science classes.
              I graduated from JCCC in spring of 2022 with my associates in Liberal Arts. I then transferred to UMKC the following fall and continuted my computer science journey there.
              I will be expecting to graduate from UMKC in the spring of 2024. Below are the list of classes that I took at JCCC and UMKC.
